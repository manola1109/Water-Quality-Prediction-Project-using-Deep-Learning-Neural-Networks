# Water-Quality-Prediction-Project-using-Deep-Learning-Neural-Networks
 This notebook builds Deep Learning Neural Network models to predict water quality based on data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India. The dataset contains water quality monitoring data from across India, with chemical and physical parameters measured at various locations over the years 2019-2022.
